Additional Notes

For a more robust development environment, consider using a code editor or IDE with support for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, such as Visual Studio Code, Atom, or Sublime Text.
You can customize the appearance and content of Vision Book Store by modifying the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files within the project directory. However, it's recommended to create a separate custom theme or branch to avoid overwriting the project's core files.
For production deployment, consider using a web hosting service to make your Vision Book Store application accessible to the public.
